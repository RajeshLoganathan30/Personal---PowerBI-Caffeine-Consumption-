## 🧠 Why I Did This

Over the span of a month, I decided to track two things that often don’t go well together:  
**Caffeine consumption** and **sleep quality**.

I’ve always been curious whether those extra cups of coffee in the afternoon were actually messing with my rest—or if it was just in my head. So instead of guessing, I turned it into a mini data project.  

This wasn't meant to be scientific or perfect, just **an honest self-experiment** to learn more about my own habits and patterns.

## 📊 What I Tracked

- ☕ **Caffeine Level** (custom score based on quantity and time of day)
- 🛌 **Sleep Duration** (actual hours of sleep per night)

I logged this daily and visualized the results using Power BI.

## 📈 What the Data Says

### 📷 Caffeine Level vs Sleeping Hours

- The **blue bars** show my caffeine level for the day.
- The **red line** tracks how many hours I slept that night.

Looking at the graph, it’s pretty clear there’s a pattern — or at least a tension — between the two. High caffeine days didn’t always lead to poor sleep, but the **consistently low sleep days often followed caffeine spikes**.

Some specific days really stood out:  
- ⚡ *Late-night coffee = regret the next morning*  
- 🌘 *Low caffeine = longer, deeper sleep*

## 🔍 What I Learned

- I don’t have to quit caffeine (yet), but I **definitely need to time it better**.
- Logging data helped me stop guessing and start seeing real patterns.
- I kind of enjoyed being my own data subject — I might do this again for something else.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Data Logging:** Google Sheets  
- **Visualization:** Power BI  
- **Hosting:** GitHub

## 💭 Final Thoughts

Sometimes the best data projects aren't about dashboards for businesses — they're about **understanding ourselves** a bit better. This one made me more mindful of my choices, and I’m sleeping better because of it.

If you’ve ever wondered whether your coffee habit is helping or hurting, I encourage you to try tracking it. You might be surprised what you find in your own patterns.
